NOTE: THERE IS A VICOUS BUG IN THE INSTALLER!!! DO NOT TICK THE BOX "Add Directories to PATH"!!!
If you tick this box, there is the possibility that your entire PATH variable may be wiped!
That action is near fatal on a lot of computers!!! Make sure you follow the instructions!

NOTE: This software CANNOT be run portably (i.e. if you want to run it on a machine, you must
first run the installer).

Original source for the software: https://sourceforge.net/projects/winavr/
